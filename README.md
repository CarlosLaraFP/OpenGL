# Rendering engine with modern OpenGL

 Rendering engine implementation to display geometric objects.

 Vertex & fragment shaders, batch rendering, OOP

 Next steps:

 * Implement instance rendering by moving CPU-side model matrix transformations to the GPU (separate VBO -> vertex shader)
 * Read mesh files from Maya/Blender/Houdini
 * Profiling via RenderDoc/Nsight
 * Implement physics as functions of time (i.e. particle system)
 * Implement lighting effects
 * 2D => 3D
